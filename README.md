This work is an attempt to derive different types of portfolio from a few bigger large CAP stocks from NIFTY50 index. This includes:

- Data collection for various stocks from NIFTY50
- Visualization of closing price evolution
- Risk and volatility measurement
- Correlation calculation
- Sharpe Ratio calculation
